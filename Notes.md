**Passing event handlers as props**

Often you’ll want the parent component to specify a child’s event handler. 
Consider buttons: depending on where you’re using a Button component, you might want to execute 
a different function—perhaps one plays a movie and another uploads an image. To do this, 
pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event handler.
